    <div class="bully-health-feature">
      <h4>Promotes Oral Hygiene</h4>
      <p>The natural chewing action on our bully sticks helps remove plaque and tartar, reducing the risk of dental disease and improving breath. Unlike synthetic chews, which may simply mask bad breath, Bonez treats address the root cause of oral health issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bully-health-feature">
      <h4>100% Digestible and Stomach-Friendly</h4>
      <p>Unlike rawhide, which can swell in a dog's stomach and lead to blockages, our bully sticks break down naturally and are easy on digestion. Even dogs with sensitive stomachs can enjoy these chews without discomfort.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bully-health-feature">
      <h4>High in Protein, Low in Fat</h4>
      <p>Our bully sticks are made only from real beef, meaning they are naturally high in protein and packed with essential nutrients to support muscle health and provide lasting energy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bully-health-feature">
      <h4>No Artificial Additives or Preservatives</h4>
      <p>Many store-bought dog treats are loaded with artificial ingredients that can lead to allergies, digestive issues, and long-term health concerns. Bonez Bully Sticks are free from harmful chemicals, so you can feel confident about what youâ€™re giving your dog.</p>
